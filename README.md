## General Context
In our multiplayer co-op game, players band together to fend off endless waves of enemies in a bid for survival. With each wave presenting a new challenge and a new opportunity to prove their mettle, our game will keep players on the edge of their seats as they fight to survive for as long as possible.

## üëò Inside Hack or Die

### ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanics
#### Gameplay Physics
* Movement
    - Standard left, right, up, down. 
    - Bound to keys, WASD.
    - Can be used in conjuntion with space bar, triggering a jump-move.
* Auto-lock 
    - Player's weapon auto-locks onto the position of the nearest enemy.
    - Player (when auto-locked) is rotated to nearest enemy during auto-lock. 
* Projectile Firing
    - Firing happens via velocity, in direction of target.
* Enemy Awareness
    - Enimies are position-aware, locking onto the player's position, then navigating to that defined point. 
* Enemy Respawning
    - Enemies respawn in waves, per duration (and targets eliminated).  
    - The nuber of enmies in a respawn is game-defined. 
* Jumping
    - Spacebar vaults the character upwards. 
    - A double can be triggered with timely taps of the spacebar.

### üé® Aesthetics
#### Environment Design
Hack or Die features an array of sectors within a level, each with its own unique aesthetic and gameplay relative purpose. The idea is to provide players the reason to explore.  

#### Character Design
The first set of characters for Hack or Die were designed with the intention of being unique, familiar, and recognizable. Concepts for both BLK and BLU were created using Midjourney and hand modeled in virtual reality.   

#### Interface Design
The interface was designed to be simple, well-organized, and verbose. The key challenge in designing the interace was arriving at a design system which could expand with the game. Also important?Having the interface feel like an element of the game, and not a "default" and / or  "design afterthought." 

#### Sound Design
The sounds of Hack or Die aim to round out gameplay on a macro and micro scale; Hack or Die's entirey was taken into account when the soundboard was created. Also, a theme of journey and exploration are relayed via Hack or Die's core soundtrack.
